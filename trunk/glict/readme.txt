Hi

This is GLICT. Dont mind the GLIT as name in the code or in files, I didnt know a GLIT already existed so I renamed it later. The code will be updated to reflect namechange.

Code's been primarily written to be included in a game called The Outcast that I'm making, but generally can be included in anything you want to include it in.

This is licensed under LGPL so that it can be included without forcing the project becoming opensource. (The Outcast, for example)

This code is so far all written by Ivan Vucica, a.k.a. Khaos. Written in DevC++.
