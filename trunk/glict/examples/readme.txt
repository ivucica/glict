To compile these programs unchanged, you'll have to put them under GLICT's folder in "examples" subfolder, so you have a path similar to "..../glict/examples/memory" for example called memory.

Getting the libraries is your responsibility. So far you'll need GLUT.
Provided are project files for DevC++ and Code::Blocks - if they don't work try making your own project from scratch.
