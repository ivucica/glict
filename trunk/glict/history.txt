31.8.2006

* Initial writing of history; anything not noted here has been done before this date
* Added visibility
* Solved focusing bug when there's no parent
* Letters on buttons now "drop in" when clicked.

4.9.2006

* Default background color of panel now same as background of window.
* Bug in MessageBox, forgot to initialize OnDismissFunction to NULL
* If messagebox is resized, button now get re-placed.

9.9.2006

* Fix for textbox when in VC++ 2005 (fixed a crash bug)

10.9.2006

* Added enabledness
* MessageBox button location fixed

13.9.2006

* Written snippets.txt file "Takeoff Snippets"

5.10.2006

* <all>.cpp: Some tabfixes in source files
* Container.cpp: Removed notice that keypress events are "in development"
* Snippets.txt: Small updates (it contains separate "history" section)
* History.txt: Added LGPL note
* Fonts.h: being that void* font parameter is not changed by the function, it maked sense to change it to const void* font for all functions and function overloads. This will probably introduce some incompatibility with some code, so please just change the void* declarations into const void*.
* Fonts.cpp: Small stuff
* Glut-helper.<all> for examples: Switched to const void* to "compatibilize" with updated fonts.h
* History.txt: Since today, every change is assigned the prefixed name of file, followed by a colon ':'

16.10.2006

* Container.<all>: Added containeroffsetx and containeroffsety, which are used to determine how far each object is shifted from left and from right. Used in e.g. windows, to make all objects NOT go under titlebar. Objects are really shifted internally, however by the blackbox principle, externally it's not visible, because GetPos() and friends return original positions & sizes. Each object actually looks into parent->containeroffsetx and parent->containeroffsety
* Container.<all>: Removed unnecessary stuff in "setclip"
* Container.<all>: Made use of containeroffsetx and containeroffsety within SetPos() and GetPos()
* Window.<all>: Made use of containeroffsety, set it to 14
* Messagebox.<all>: Made messagebox aware of containeroffset* changes in window
* <all>: This ended up with disfunctional WINDOW. Need to repair, systematically.

17.10.2006

* Container.<all>: Fixed the containeroffset*.

18.10.2006

* Scrollbar.<all>: Added, done code up to scroller (meaning clickable top and bottom windows with working highlight) and declared SetMax(), SetMin(), SetValue() and SetStep() and corresponding Get*() functions

19.10.2006

* Scrollbar.<all>: Made it all work, scroller looks perfect

5.11.2006

* Discovered that GLICT test proggy does not work good, at all. It appears that bug is deeply buried within the system.

27.12.2006

* Container.<all>: Fixed some problems that have arisen (hopefully, the problem from 5.11.2006 too; didn't check)
* Container.<all>: Fixed a crash occurence; another one arose, however

30.12.2006

* examples/memory/main.cpp: you-have-won messagebox is added to the "Board" window to demonstrate possibility to add windows to other windows (although they can be added to anything). this revealed a bug with titlebar-based offsets
* Window.cpp: Added documentation for CastEvent
* Doxyfile: minor changes (e.g. made doxygen not parse exchndl.cxx because it's not really a part of GLICT)
* *.*: Added at least basic class descriptions. And somewhere, some more doc.

8.1.2007

* *.*: Removed debugging printf's

11.2.2007

* *.cpp: Fixed problems with culling.
* *.*: Changed copyright notice to say '2006-2007'.

22.2.2007

* Container.cpp: Documented some more functions
* Container.*: Added SetOnPaint() function and OnPaint() function pointer variable; added functionality
* Types.h: Added glictRect type

23.2.2007

* Container.cpp: Got rid of some glPushMatrix() and glPopMatrix() when rendering in Paint(); translate and negative translate will do fine, instead
* Main.cpp: Triangle rendering example within a window is working
* Glut-helper.cpp: Fixed \r, \r\n and \n\r rendering. Textbox can now accept enters in the "main.cpp" example :P

24.2.2007

* *.cpp: Messed some more with removing redundant and adding necessary matrix code

17.3.2007

* Container.cpp: When calling OnClick, we no longer pass the absolute coordinates, but relative coordinates.
* Window.cpp: Changed behavior of OnPaint()

20.3.2007

* Skinner.*: Files created, some initial stuff typed in

29.3.2007

* Panel.cpp: Panel now handles OnPaint(), too

4.4.2007

21.4.2007:

* Skinner.*: Added support for binding textures using callbacks with a parameter instead of binding with textureid

22.4.2007:

* Container.*: Added special function for delayed removal - DelayedRemove()
* Panel.*: Added VirtualScrollBottom()

25.4.2007:

* Panel.cpp, Container.cpp: Fixed a glitch related to clicks penetrating into virtual area; it could not be selected although it was visible
* History.txt: From now on, extensions ".*" will not be written
* Panel, Container: Moving virtualsize property and functions from panel to container, although only panel supports it
* Panel, Container: Added virtualpos property, which is a duplicate of scrollbars' properties
* Panel, Container: Fixed clickability of items that are only in virtual area, at least on first level of recursion
* Container.h: Added GetX() and GetY()

26.4.2007:

* GLICTMemory/main.cpp: Updated for latest GLICT API. Still does not use skinning, tho :P

28.4.2007:

* Skinner: Messed up a bit with bind callbacks -- turns out the implementation was pretty messy after all ...

29.4.2007:

* Panel.cpp: Fixed a bug that caused panel not to call OnMouseDown()

23.5.2007:

7. 7. 2007:

* Container.h: AddObject(), RemoveObject(), SetWidth() and SetHeight() became virtuals
* List: Added listbox widget
* Skinner.cpp: Fixed a bug in constructor (missed adding a "f" when initializing topf, topleftf, etc. callbacks)
