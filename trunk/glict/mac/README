Thanks to Third Cog Software (Joachim Bengtsson, you rock!) for help from their 
site with regards how to properly produce frameworks, and for help on 
how to properly embed frameworks.

Also I found a blog entry that told me that I need to select header files to be PUBLIC in
order for them to be included in framework. Thanks to PantherModem!

NOTE!

Apparently I haven't managed to set the installation directory correctly.
So when compiling your application, in XCode, add a "Run shell script" build
phase to your executable target. Rename it "Fix GLICT" and in the script put
this code:

--CUTHERE--
# http://thirdcog.eu/apps/frameworks
function relocateLibraryInCurrentApp() {
  install_name_tool -change $1$2 @executable_path/../Frameworks/$2 $CONFIGURATION_BUILD_DIR/$EXECUTABLE_PATH
}
relocateLibraryInCurrentApp /Users/ivucica/Library/Frameworks/ GLICT.framework/Versions/A/GLICT #note the space
--CUTHERE--

Of course don't copy paste the --CUTHERE-- lines.
